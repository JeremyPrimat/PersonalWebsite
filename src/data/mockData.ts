Key practices also involve proper error handling, testing, and following established patterns like composition over inheritance.\n\nAdditional best practices:\n- Use TypeScript for better type safety\n- Implement proper error boundaries\n- Follow consistent naming conventions\n- Use custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Optimize bundle size with code splitting\n- Implement comprehensive testing strategies",

    content: "Microservices architecture involves breaking down applications into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Here's a comprehensive approach:\n\n**Service Design Principles:**\n- Single Responsibility: Each service should have one business capability\n- Autonomous: Services should be independently deployable\n- Decentralized: Avoid shared databases and centralized governance\n- Resilient: Design for failure and implement circuit breakers\n\n**Communication Patterns:**\n- Synchronous: REST APIs, GraphQL for real-time needs\n- Asynchronous: Message queues, event streaming for loose coupling\n- API Gateway: Centralized entry point for client requests\n\n**Data Management:**\n- Database per service pattern\n- Event sourcing for audit trails\n- CQRS for read/write separation\n- Eventual consistency strategies",

Unlike traditional CMSes that tightly couple content management with presentation, headless CMSes provide content via APIs.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- API-first approach for content delivery\n- Frontend technology agnostic\n- Separation of concerns between content and presentation\n- Cloud-native and scalable architecture\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Flexibility**: Use any frontend technology (React, Vue, mobile apps)\n- **Omnichannel**: Deliver content to multiple platforms\n- **Performance**: Optimized content delivery and caching\n- **Developer Experience**: Modern development workflows\n- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of content and presentation",
