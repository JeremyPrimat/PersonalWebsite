## Should I Use SSG or SSR for Better SEO and Performance?

You’ve built a beautiful site. Now comes the question:  
**How do I make sure search engines see it, index it, and rank it well?**

If you’re using a modern frontend framework like Next.js, you’ve probably come across two common rendering strategies: **Static Site Generation (SSG)** and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.

Both can help with SEO, but they serve different purposes. Let’s break it down.

## 🚀 Why SSG is Fast and SEO-Friendly

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** builds your pages at build time. The result? Plain old HTML—ready to be served from a CDN.

It’s like pre-cooking meals before guests arrive. When someone visits your site:
> No cooking. Just serving.

Benefits of SSG:
- ⚡ **Blazing-fast performance** — pages load instantly from the edge.
- 🔒 **Highly cacheable** — great for scalability and cost.
- 🧭 **SEO-friendly** — bots love HTML that’s ready to crawl.

That makes SSG ideal for:
- Marketing pages
- Documentation
- Blog articles
- Product landing pages

But what if your data changes frequently?

## 🕓 Why SSR Keeps Content Fresh

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** generates HTML *on demand*, every time someone visits the page. That means content is always fresh and up-to-date.

It’s like cooking meals to order.

Benefits of SSR:
- 🧠 **Dynamic data** — fetches fresh content on each request.
- 📈 **SEO-compatible** — bots still get full HTML.
- 🔁 **Personalization** — content can adapt to the user or session.

That makes SSR perfect for:
- User dashboards
- Product pages with stock levels
- Personalized content
- Real-time data views

## ⚠️ Heads-Up: Mixing SSR and ISR in Next.js

> **Important:** In Next.js, if an **ISR page** (using `getStaticProps` with `revalidate`) is at a higher route level (e.g. `/blog/[slug]`), you **cannot** nest an **SSR page** (using `getServerSideProps`) beneath it (e.g. `/blog/[slug]/analytics`).

This limitation exists because ISR pages are statically generated and served from the cache, whereas SSR pages require a server context — and they can't coexist in certain routing trees.

**Recommendation:** Structure your routes so that SSR pages are not children of statically generated (ISR) pages. Consider isolating dynamic logic or moving the route to a separate top-level folder.

## 🤝 Can I Mix Both?

Yes! And you probably should.

Frameworks like Next.js let you use **SSG by default**, and opt-in to **SSR or ISR** for specific pages.

That way, you get:
- The speed of static content,
- The freshness of dynamic data,
- And the SEO boost from server-rendered HTML.

## 🧩 TL;DR

**SSG is fast. SSR is fresh.**  
Use SSG when content rarely changes. Use SSR when content needs to stay dynamic. Use both when your site demands flexibility — just be careful with how you nest them in your routing.

📌 *Modern frameworks let you pick the best of both worlds—don’t choose between speed and freshness when you can have both.*
