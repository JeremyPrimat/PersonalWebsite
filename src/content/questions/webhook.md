## Why Should You Use Webhooks Instead of Polling in MACH-Based Architectures?

In a modern composable stack—built on MACH principles (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless)—modularity and real-time communication are crucial. Each system acts independently, but together they form a powerful, flexible whole.

But how do you keep all these independent systems in sync?

## The Problem with Polling

Have you ever been in the car with a bunch of kids on a road trip?

They’re super excited. You’ve barely left the driveway and it starts:

> “Are we there yet? Are we there yet?”

You say, “No, we’ve got at least another hour.” But two minutes later:

> “How about now? Are we there yet?”

Now imagine your software doing the same thing.

That’s **polling**.

Polling is when one system constantly asks another, “Anything new? How about now?” It happens when systems rely on data from each other but don't have a built-in way to communicate changes.

Some examples:
- A boiler checking the thermostat every second to see if the temperature has changed.
- A frontend polling an API for the latest updates.
- An e-commerce site pinging the PIM (Product Information Management) to see if new products are available.
- A PIM constantly checking a DAM (Digital Asset Manager) for new images.

Polling might seem simple, but it's inefficient:
- It creates unnecessary load on systems.
- It increases latency.
- It doesn't scale well.

It's like hiring a junior developer just to keep refreshing the page, saying:
> “Is it done yet? How about now?”

## 🧠 Webhooks: The Smarter Alternative

Instead of asking over and over, what if your system could just be told when something important happens?

That's where **webhooks** come in.

Webhooks let systems listen for specific events and notify others when those events occur. They enable **event-driven communication** between decoupled services—perfect for MACH-based architectures.

### ✅ Real-World Examples:
- A new product is published in the PIM → webhook notifies the frontend to update.
- A customer places an order → webhook triggers a fulfillment workflow.
- A DAM adds a new image → webhook tells the PIM it’s available.

## 🔗 Why Webhooks Matter in MACH and Composable Commerce

Webhooks are essential for composable commerce, where loosely connected services need to work together in real time. They enable:
- 🔁 **Loose coupling** — services remain modular and replaceable.
- ⚙️ **Event-driven flows** — trigger actions only when needed.
- 🚀 **Fast integration** — no need for complex polling logic.
- 🔐 **Scalable & efficient communication** — no wasteful chatter.

In MACH architecture, agility and modularity are everything. Webhooks support that by making systems proactive instead of reactive.

## 🧩 TL;DR

**Polling is noisy. Webhooks are smart.**  
Don’t build systems that constantly ask _“Are we there yet?”_ — build systems that know **when they’ve arrived**.

📌 *Webhooks turn reactive systems into proactive experiences — because great architecture doesn’t ask, it listens.*
