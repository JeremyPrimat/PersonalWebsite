## How Do a Headless CMS and a CDP Usually Work Together?

If you're building a composable stack with a Headless CMS and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), you might wonder:

> "Should these two systems talk directly to each other?"

In most real-world scenarios, the answer is **no** â€” they don't communicate directly. Instead, they interact **through the frontend**, and usually for one main reason: **personalization**.

## Different Roles, Different Paths

- **CMS** delivers structured content: pages, components, product descriptions, media.
- **CDP** collects user behavior data and builds segments: who is browsing, clicking, converting.
- **Frontend** becomes the bridge: it receives content from the CMS and user data from the CDP, and combines them to serve personalized experiences.

## the Integration Flows

Hereâ€™s what usually happens:
- The CMS delivers content to the frontend.
- The frontend tracks the user's interactions and behaviors.
- That behavioral data is sent to the CDP.
- The CDP builds or updates segments in real-time.
- The frontend may then fetch personalized content or adjust UI components based on the user's segment or profile.

In other words: **content flows from the CMS to the frontend**, while **behavioral data flows from the frontend to the CDP** â€” and only in the frontend are they actually combined.

## Bonus: The Reverse Flow (CMS to CDP)

Though less common, there are cases where the CMS can also push data to the CDP.

For example:
- You might track which types of content users view inside the CMS-rendered experience (e.g. blog categories, product pages, video interactions).
- That metadata can be forwarded to the CDP to improve its segmentation logic.
- This allows the CDP to make smarter decisions â€” which in turn enables the CMS to personalize content based on that updated insight.

This creates a feedback loop:
1. **CMS delivers content.**
2. **Frontend tracks engagement.**
3. **CDP updates segmentation.**
4. **Frontend uses new segments to fetch or adjust CMS content.**
